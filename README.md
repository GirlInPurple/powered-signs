# Powered Signs

When the block below a sign is powered, it will print its contents to any player's chat who is within 32 blocks of the sign.\
The exact distance can be changed in the configs.\
### A few things to note:
- There is a 10 tick cooldown per sign
- There will be no forge version
  - Unless someone else does it, full permission to do so
- The configs are located in `./config/poweredsign.toml`
- Particle effects will be added in the future.

## Quick Tutorial:

- Place a sign, and write on the front side, then back
- If you power the block below the sign, the contents of the sign will be printed
  - even if the sign is on a wall, the block below it is still the block you need to power
  - this will be tweaked later
- the order of what is printed is front side top to bottom, back side top to bottom
