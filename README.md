# Powered Signs

When the block below a sign is powered, it will print its contents to any player's chat who is within 32 blocks of the sign.\
The exact distance can be changed in the configs.\
A few things to note:
- There is a 8 tick cooldown per sign
- There will be no forge version
- A config system is work in progress
